# Benchmark measurement report

Every raw sample, failed phase and configuration is retained in `samples.tsv`.
Metadata and source/input snapshots accompany this report. Compilation is
separate from execution. Fresh samples include process startup and shutdown;
repeated samples time Benchmark.run in process. First rounds are retained;
no steady-state or causal performance claim is inferred. Times are seconds.
IQR endpoints use linear interpolation at (n-1)*p. Counts are instructions/bytes/objects.
